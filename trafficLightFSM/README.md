A bonus project worth 4%, task is to implement a traffic light system at an intersection using a finite state machine, structs to represent states, and timers to vary
how long each light takes (greens stay on longer than yellow for example). See "Details" for pdf and setup photo. Note that the wires are connected to different pins than
in the setup.jpg which are the correct pins.
